# About this project

This project was made for the Cidade Alta Police. <br /><br />
It's a simple project where users will have access to the city's penal codes, as well as create and remove as well. <br/><br />
In the project I found some challenges, like making the login system, because I didn't have a complete api with login, so I had to do it another way. But it's working!<br /> <br />
So, that's all, folks! ‚ù§Ô∏è
